# BIB data extraction for test

We selected a small subset of UC Davis Library's bibliographic data in order to perform end-to-end testing of our implementation.
Our target data is LC subject heading "Great Britain -- History -- 20th century".
See the bib extract script, (insert-filename-here).
This script is run manually on the UC Davis ILS server.
